                <p>Lately I have been working on <a href="https://github.com/CharlyCst/zephyr">my own compiler</a> (for fun &amp; glory) targeting WebAssembly. The inner working of a compiler is well documented and there are plenty of production-grade examples to look at (for instance this <a href="http://craftinginterpreters.com/">book</a> and the <a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/">rustc dev guide</a>), but when it comes down to writing bytes one after the other the only thing you can hold onto is the <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/">specification</a>.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the specification is great, but it may be a little rough at first. I spent quite some time wrapping my head around branching, number encoding, types and sections, so I feel like I should write that down.</p>
<p>And here we are! In this post I will walk you through the bytes of a simple wasm module, one by one, and by the end you&rsquo;ll be able to tell what <em>any</em> of those do.</p>
<h2 id="the-wasm-stack-machine">The wasm stack machine</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the basics: what is WebAssembly (wasm) exactly?</p>
<p>WebAssembly is a set of binary instructions which looks like that with your favorite hex dumper:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span style="display:flex;"><span>00000000: 0061 736d 0100 0000 0107 0160 027f 7f01  .asm.......`....
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>00000010: 7f03 0201 0007 0701 0361 6464 0000 0a09  .........add....
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>00000020: 0107 0020 0020 016a 0b                   ... . .j.
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>But you may be more familiar with its textual form (<em>wat</em>, standing for WebAssembly Text):</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-wasm" data-lang="wasm">(module
  (func $add (param $lhs i32) (param $rhs i32) (result i32)
    get_local $lhs
    get_local $rhs
    i32.add)
  (export &#34;add&#34; (func $add))
)
</code></pre><p>There are tools to go from one to the other, if you are planning to get your hands dirty with wasm I strongly recommend investing in such <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt">tooling</a>, it will save you many hours of debugging.</p>
<p>Those instructions are targeting a stack based virtual machine following the WasAssembly specification, there are plenty of such VM out there: the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/tree/master/interpreter">reference interpreter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime">Wasmtime</a> or the one in your browser to quote a few.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;stack based&rsquo; part means that the VM is doing its calculation on a stack, to compute <code>3 + 5</code> it first pushes 3 onto the top of the stack, then 5 and finally uses the <code>add</code> instruction which consume the topmost two values and push the result back on the stack.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-wasm" data-lang="wasm">i32.const 3
i32.const 5
i32.add
</code></pre>
    <figure class="center" >
        <img src="/img/wasmEncoding/stack.jpg"  alt="Stack machine"   class="rounded"/>

        
    </figure>


<p>There is another common family of VM called register-based, which as you guess operate on registers. With such an instruction set adding 3 and 5 would be done in a single instruction, if you already have the values somewhere. It may look like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-wasm" data-lang="wasm">(; store the result of register_a + register_b in register_c ;)
i32.add register_c register_a register_b
</code></pre><p>As you can see overall register based machines tend to use fewer instructions, they also tend to be faster to interpret because they require less instruction dispatch, but the code size tend to be larger (<a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/vee05/full_papers/p153-yunhe.pdf">here</a> is a very interesting comparison if you are interested).</p>
<p>But back to WabAssembly, targeting a stack machine is a good thing for us, compiler writers, because it&rsquo;s generally easier: we don&rsquo;t have to bother with registers at all.</p>
<h2 id="the-module-structure">The module structure</h2>
<p>Wasm code is separated into <strong>modules</strong>, each module contains a given number of <strong>sections</strong> which in turn have their own layout.</p>
<p>Before digging into the details I have to warn you that we are going to write quite a few bytes by hand, so from now on I may omit the <code>0x</code> part before hexadecimal numbers: consider that every number that follows are written in hexadecimal.</p>
<p>A module always starts with the magic number <code>00 61 73 6d</code> followed by the version number, 01 at the time of writing, or <code>01 00 00 00</code> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Little-endian">little-endian</a>. You may have noticed that the magic number corresponds to the string <code>\0asm</code>, you can spot it in the hexdump I showed at the beginning.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s write our very first wasm module (in bytes of course):</p>

    <figure class="center" >
        <img src="/img/wasmEncoding/header.jpg"  alt="Wasm header"   class="rounded"/>

        
    </figure>


<p>It&rsquo;s not very useful for now, we will need to add a few sections to actually do something with our module.</p>
<p>At the time of writing there are 11 predefined sections:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>Section name   code     description

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Data           0x0b   <span style="color:#75715e"># Any type of data</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That is a lot, I will just walk you through a few of them, you can learn more by reading the
<a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/">spec</a> (or reading other posts ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).</p>
<h2 id="writing-a-wasm-function">Writing a wasm function</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say we want to put an &lsquo;add&rsquo; section in our module, we will need three sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type</strong>: we need to register the type of our function, in this case let&rsquo;s say <code>(i32, i32) -&gt; i32</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Function</strong>: once the type is declared, we need to declare a function with that type.</li>
<li><strong>Code</strong>: finally we put the body of the function in the Code section.</li>
</ul>
<p>This may seems like a lot of work for defining a simple function, but this can be rationalized by the goals of WebAssembly:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Define a portable, size- and load-time-efficient binary format to serve as a compilation target.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/high-level-goals/">WebAssembly High-Level Goals</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By defining all the types in one place we can avoid duplication, if you have a thousand functions with type <code>i32 -&gt; i32</code> you just need to declare it once and refer to it in multiple functions declaration, saving precious bytes of bandwidth. Similarly, a note in the specification justify the separation of Function and Code as a way to enable parallel and streaming compilation.</p>
<p>A section is encoded in three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>One byte for its id, e.g. <code>0x01</code> for Type and so on.</li>
<li>Its size encoded as a <code>u32</code>, more on that later.</li>
<li>The content, this actually depend on the section.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="declaring-a-type">Declaring a type</h3>
<p>The <em>Type</em> section is rather simple, it starts with the number of types (a <code>u32</code>) and then simply encodes each type one after the other. At this point we have no choice but to grab the <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/">specification</a> (unfortunately I&rsquo;m not yet sponsored to promote the spec&hellip;).</p>
<p>Have a look at the &ldquo;Binary Format&rdquo; chapter, there we learn that the value type <code>i32</code> is encoded by <code>0x7f</code>. The function type is a little more complicated:, it starts with <code>0x60</code> followed by a vector of parameters types and another vector for return types. Vectors are simply encoded as their size followed by the actual elements.</p>
<h4 id="a-word-on-integers">A word on integers</h4>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to talk about integer encoding in WASM, because we need it to encode sizes of vectors and the section itself. WebAssembly is meant to be compact and thus uses a compressed representation for integers, more precisely the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128">LEB128 encoding</a> (standing for Little Endian Base 128).</p>
<p>The little endian part means that the least significant bytes goes first, while the base 128 part is because we actually only use 7 bits out of 8 in each byte: the eighth bit is either 1 if there are still non-zero bits to comes, 0 otherwise. Thanks to the eighth bit there is no need to add leading zeroes
(well, actually trailing zeroes in little endian&hellip;). It saves precious bytes of bandwidth.</p>

    <figure class="center" >
        <img src="/img/wasmEncoding/leb.jpg"  alt="LEB128 encoding of 70 000"   class="rounded"/>

        
    </figure>


<p>Actually we will never use integers larger than 128 in this post, but that is the reason why integers only use one byte in the following.</p>
<p>Now we know all we need to encode the type section: let&rsquo;s put everything together.</p>
<p>To encode the type <code> (i32, i32) -&gt; i32</code>we need a vector of size 2 containing two times <code>i32</code> for the arguments and one of size 1 for the return type.</p>

    <figure class="center" >
        <img src="/img/wasmEncoding/type_1.jpg"  alt="Type section"   class="rounded"/>

        
    </figure>


<p>There is only one type in our type sections</p>

    <figure class="center" >
        <img src="/img/wasmEncoding/type_2.jpg"  alt="Type section"   class="rounded"/>

        
    </figure>


<p>Finally, we can compute its size, 7 bytes, and add the section ID <code>0x01</code></p>

    <figure class="center" >
        <img src="/img/wasmEncoding/type_3.jpg"  alt="Type section"   class="rounded"/>

        
            <figcaption class="center" >The Type section</figcaption>
        
    </figure>


<p>And we are done with our first section 🎉</p>
<h3 id="registering-a-function">Registering a function</h3>
<p>Now we need to register a function, are you ready? This is going to be very fast:</p>
<p>We have a single function, and it has the type with index 0 of the Type section we just wrote</p>

    <figure class="center" >
        <img src="/img/wasmEncoding/fun_1.jpg"  alt="Function section"   class="rounded"/>

        
    </figure>


<p>The Function section ID is <code>0x03</code>, its size is 2</p>

    <figure class="center" >
        <img src="/img/wasmEncoding/fun_2.jpg"  alt="Function section"   class="rounded"/>

        
            <figcaption class="center" >The Function section</figcaption>
        
    </figure>


<p>And boom! The Function section is done!</p>
<h3 id="adding-the-function-body">Adding the function body</h3>
<p>It is the part where we actually encore the body of our function, inside the <em>Code</em> section.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-wasm" data-lang="wasm">func $add (param $lhs i32) (param $rhs i32) (result i32)
    get_local $lhs
    get_local $rhs
    i32.add
</code></pre><p>There is only three instructions to encode: two <code>get_local</code> and a <code>i32.add</code>. We need to check the spec here, it says that <code>get_local</code> is encoded by the byte <code>0x20</code> followed by its argument, that is the index of the function argument we want to get back. So <code>get_local $first_argument</code> is encoded <code>20 00</code> while <code>get_local $second_argument</code> is <code>20 01</code>.</p>
<p>The instruction <code>i32.add</code> doesn&rsquo;t take any argument (because WebAssembly is a stack machine), it just removes the top two values of the stack and put back the sum, it is encoded by the byte <code>0x6a</code>.</p>
<p>The spec also says that the function body must end with a special <code>end</code> instruction, encoded by <code>0x0b</code></p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s it, the body of our <code>add</code> function is encoded as:</p>

    <figure class="center" >
        <img src="/img/wasmEncoding/code_1.jpg"  alt="Code section"   class="rounded"/>

        
    </figure>


<p>We also need to specify a vector of locals, but we don&rsquo;t use any here, so it&rsquo;s an empty vector encoded by its size (0) with no elements, in other words the single byte <code>0x00</code></p>

    <figure class="center" >
        <img src="/img/wasmEncoding/code_2.jpg"  alt="Code section"   class="rounded"/>

        
    </figure>


<p>The body of the first (and only) function is 7 bytes long:</p>

    <figure class="center" >
        <img src="/img/wasmEncoding/code_3.jpg"  alt="Code section"   class="rounded"/>

        
    </figure>


<p>We are done for the body of the section, it is 9 bytes long and the section has an ID of <code>0x0a</code>, thus the complete section is:</p>

    <figure class="center" >
        <img src="/img/wasmEncoding/code_4.jpg"  alt="Code section"   class="rounded"/>

        
            <figcaption class="center" >The Code section</figcaption>
        
    </figure>


<p>In case you are wondering, I&rsquo;m not guessing what the section should look like, I just followed the spec once again: you can find the details in the subsection <em>Module</em> of the chapter <em>Binary Format</em>.</p>
<h3 id="bonus-exporting-a-function">Bonus: exporting a function</h3>
<p>At this point we are done, you can put those three section together and you have a working <code>add</code> function. The function is not exported, however, so you have no way to check if it works&hellip; Actually we just need one extra section to play with our handwritten wasm: the <em>Export</em> section, which as you may guess is responsible for telling which function is exported, and under which name.</p>
<p>To declare and export we need three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A name.</li>
<li>The kind of thing to be exported (it is not limited to function).</li>
<li>Its index into the corresponding section.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our case the name is <code>add</code>, which corresponds to the bytes <code>61 64 64</code>, plus the size of the name, that gives us <code>03 61 64 64</code>.</p>
<p>We export a function, according to the spec we should prefix its ID by <code>00</code>, and because the function ID is also zero, that gives us:</p>

    <figure class="center" >
        <img src="/img/wasmEncoding/export_1.jpg"  alt="Export section"   class="rounded"/>

        
    </figure>


<p>We have a single export, thus we have to prefix the section body by <code>01</code> which gives us a total size of 7 bytes. Because the section ID is <code>0x07</code>, the whole export section is encoded by:</p>

    <figure class="center" >
        <img src="/img/wasmEncoding/export_2.jpg"  alt="Export section"   class="rounded"/>

        
            <figcaption class="center" >The Export section</figcaption>
        
    </figure>


<h2 id="putting-everything-together">Putting everything together</h2>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it! If we put each section back to back (plus the wasm module header), we get a valid and (kind of) usable wasm module!</p>

    <figure class="center" >
        <img src="/img/wasmEncoding/module.jpg"  alt="Wasm module"   class="rounded"/>

        
            <figcaption class="center" >A valid wasm module containing an `add` function</figcaption>
