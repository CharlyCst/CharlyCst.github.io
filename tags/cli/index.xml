      <description>TLA⁺ is a formal language for modelling concurrent and distributed systems in the form of a mathematical specification. TLA⁺ is often used with a set of tools, such as the TLC model checker, distributed with the official TLA⁺ IDE: the TLA⁺ toolbox.&#xA;The toolbox is fine, but I personally prefer to edit my specifications using my favorite editor rather than a specialized IDE. Turns out running the TLA⁺ tools from the command line is quite simple yet not very well documented, that&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to write down my process for using TLA⁺ outside of the toolbox, hope it helps!</description>

      <description>I recently published my very first crate, a new step in my journey learning rust. I really enjoyed developing it and as it started becoming usable enough for my own needs I decided to publish it, so let&amp;rsquo;s do it properly!&#xA;Before jumping in and telling you what that crate actually is about, let&amp;rsquo;s start with some context.&#xA;This code does not compile As a hobby project for the last couple of months I have been building my very own compiler.</description>
