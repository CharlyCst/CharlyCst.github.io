      <description>I while ago I was tasked to find predefined patterns in strings, a well known problem in computer science. Our algorithm was running on AWS Lambda using the Node.js runtime, and, considering that we sometimes needed to search through billions of strings, performances of this algorithm were crucial.
On the other hand I recently paid a lot of attention to WebAssembly and Rust, both technologies seem really promising and attract a growing interest from developers.</description>
