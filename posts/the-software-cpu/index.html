                <p>Hardware and software have always been treated as if they were alien to each others, like oil and water, or mind and body.
They feel so different because one we can touch, and the other we can&rsquo;t.
Yet, when writing software, the system engineer has to think not of one and the other, but of the combination of the two.
Hardware and software need to blend together.</p>
<p>System software exist in two distinct dimensions: in its abstract form as source code, and its embodiment as a binary on a machine or an emulator.
In stark contrast, the hardware only exists in its physical form, or as a virtual simulation of its physical form.
This makes developing system software unnecessary difficult, as the engineer always has to wrangle with the full complexity of a real machine, rather than iterate in the realm of abstract.</p>
<p>Consider an ubiquitous system problem: memory protection.
How would an engineer test the configuration of memory protection? The format of a page table? Or that the TLB has been properly flushed?
With integration tests.
By construction an entire world, a full kernel, new trap handlers, and test processes.
We treat the CPU like physicists treat black holes: inscrutable objects that we can only understand by observing the effect of their presence.</p>
<p>But CPUs are not black holes, we know with certainty how they behave because we built them.
TODO: what if we could bring back CPU in the realm of abstract? Observe the inner gears directly rather than their consequences?</p>
