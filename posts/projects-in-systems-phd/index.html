            </h1>

            

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>It has now been over four years since the start of my PhD.
I consider myself lucky, over the course of those four years there is only one thing that I wish I did differently: <em>picking what to work on</em>.</p>
<p>When talking with people earlier in their PhD journey the question of what to work on often comes back.
PhDs in computer systems are especially tricky, because of the time and energy it takes to get a project all the way through the finish line.
I learned some of this myself the hard way, and decided to write this post to help future systems grad students navigate their PhD better than I did.
However, keep in mind that a PhD is first and foremost about learning how to think for yourself.
What worked for me might not work for you, listen to others but make your own choices.</p>
<h2 id="long-projects">Long Projects</h2>
<p>When deciding what to work on as a first project in a systems PhD there are often a few <em>great attractors</em>.
Fun systems that are just exciting to work on.
New kernels and compilers are typical examples, I know because I promptly started writing a new kernel during my first year.
Those kinds of projects are examples of what I call <em>long projects</em>, i.e. projects that will take at least one or two years to build, and one more year to publish.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with long projects, I did two myself, but you need to think of them as such.
Research projects are inherently risky: we can&rsquo;t know for sure if it is going to work, because by definition it has to be novel.
If you are to work two years on a project, you want it to be worth it.</p>
<p>In a systems PhD there are two kinds of risks: <em>technical risks</em>, and <em>publication risks</em>.</p>
<p>The technical risk is the risk that the project will simply not work, or that the results will not be as good as expected.
The obvious solution to limit those risk is to write down all your assumptions and to validate them as early as possible, before putting-in the bulk of the work.</p>
<p>The publication risk is more pernicious, you might have built a system that lives-up to your expectations, but that the community is not interested in.
In other words, you your paper always gets rejected.
In those cases you have two options: to continue working on the project, or to move on to something else.
You will need to use your best judgment to decide what to do, but I have seen both options work out just fine in different situations.
For me, moving on was the right choice, for one of my labmate pushing his project through four years of PhD paid of.
In those cases listen to your guts: is the time you are spending on that project worth it?</p>
<h2 id="the-learning-curve">The Learning Curve</h2>
<p>One important thing to keep in mind during your PhD is the learning curve.
As you learn more about building and using systems you will become better and better at building and using more systems.
In systems in particular, the learning curve is not linear.
There are a lot of moving pieces and tribal knowledge, the more you master, the more connections you can make and the better your research will be.</p>
<p>As a consequence, it is very important to optimize for learning.</p>
