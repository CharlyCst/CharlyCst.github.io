      <description>I recently published my very first crate, a new step in my journey learning rust. I really enjoyed developing it and as it started becoming usable enough for my own needs I decided to publish it, so let&amp;rsquo;s do it properly!
Before jumping in and telling you what that crate actually is about, let&amp;rsquo;s start with some context.
This code does not compile As a hobby project for the last couple of months I have been building my very own compiler.</description>
